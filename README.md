# Whiteboard App

A collaborative whiteboard iOS app where friends can share a space to add photos, text, and drawings.

## Features

- **Shared Whiteboards**: Create and share whiteboards with friends
- **Real-time Updates**: See changes in real-time
- **Widget Support**: View latest whiteboard updates on your home screen
- **Multiple Content Types**: Add images, text, and drawings
- **Apple Sign In**: Secure authentication with Sign in with Apple

## Technical Overview

### Architecture

The app follows a clean architecture approach:

- **UI Layer**: SwiftUI views and presentation logic
- **Domain Layer**: Business logic and models
- **Data Layer**: Local and remote data management

### Key Technologies

- SwiftUI for UI
- WidgetKit for home screen widgets
- Sign in with Apple for authentication
- UserDefaults for local data persistence (will be replaced with a backend)

## Backend Considerations

For a scalable backend, the following options could be considered:

1. **Firebase**:

   - Firestore for real-time database
   - Firebase Auth for authentication
   - Firebase Storage for images
   - Firebase Cloud Functions for serverless logic

2. **AWS Amplify**:

   - AppSync for GraphQL API and real-time data
   - Cognito for authentication
   - S3 for image storage
   - Lambda for serverless functions

3. **Custom Solution**:
   - Node.js/Express backend
   - MongoDB or PostgreSQL database
   - WebSockets for real-time updates
   - S3 or similar for image storage

## Future Improvements

- Implement backend integration
- Add real-time collaboration features
- Enhance drawing capabilities
- Add more widget customization options
- Implement push notifications for updates
